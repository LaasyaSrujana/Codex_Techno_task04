# Task 4: Email Spam Detection 

This project is about building a machine learning model that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Natural Language Processing techniques.

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer
- Gradio (for deployment)

# Files Included:
- `email_spam_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code
- `spam.zip`: Dataset file
- `spam_output.png`: Screenshot of the output
- `demo_video_link.txt`: Contains Google Drive link to demo video

# Features:
- Text preprocessing and vectorization
- Model training using Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall
- Deployed using Gradio for live prediction

# Video Demo:
The working Gradio model demo can be viewed ()
